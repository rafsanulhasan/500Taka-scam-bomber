### Simple Instruction
Couldn't make it more user friendly but it will get your job done...

#### Install Dependency:
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
It will install puppeteer, so make sure you have unlimited internet...

#### Usage
It has a file called ```app.js```. Simply run it using node js and pass the website url as argument:
```
node app http://earn500dotfun/
```

### What it does?
It simply fill-up all the fields and keep submitting one after other... That's it... It would be more helpful if we can somehow make the criminals more confused with real looking fake data. I couldn't make it as I don't have enough time at my hand. I will appreciate if you can do that.
